What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do that?

When 'git init' is run in a directory, all meta data files of a
repository are created. This is needed so that subsequent commits
can be performed successfully. 




How is staging area different from working directory and repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area can be used to temporarily group together the changes that
will form a part of commit. Changes saved in staging area are not yet
part of a commit and hence can be changed. Also, staging area allows
changes to several files to be grouped together and tied to a common
description of the change.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Inspect the changes to ensure that all changes are related to the logical change and
there are no changes that not related to the logical change. git diff --stage can
help.
